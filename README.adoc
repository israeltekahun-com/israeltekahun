This guide walks you through the process of creating a "`Hello, World`" RESTful web
service with Spring.

== What You Will Build

You will build a service that will accept HTTP GET requests at
`http://localhost:8080/manualsync?database=${harbor database name}&collection=${harbor collection name}&file=${log file name}&ipAddress=${ip address}`.

You will build a service that will accept HTTP GET requests at
`http://localhost:8080/defaultsync?file=${log file name}&ipAddress=${ip address}`.


It will respond with a JSON representation of a response, as the following listing shows:

====
[source,json]
----
{"content": "finished default synking from fileName"}
----
====

====
[source,json]
----
{"content": "finished synking in db: databaseName , col:  collectionName  from  fileName}

== Starting with Spring Initializr

For all Spring applications, you should start with the https://start.spring.io[Spring
Initializr]. The Initializr offers a fast way to pull in all the dependencies you need for
an application and does a lot of the setup for you. This example needs only the Spring Web
dependency. The following image shows the Initializr set up for this sample project:

NOTE: The preceding image shows the Initializr with Maven chosen as the build tool. It also shows values of `com.example` and `rest-service` as the Group
and Artifact, respectively. You will use those values throughout the rest of this sample.

The following listing shows the `pom.xml` file that is created when you choose Maven:

== Syncing
===== 1. Create a replica set that has only one primary member. 
https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/deploy-replica-set/
===== 2. Save the update logs in a file
```shell
$ mongo | tee ${path}\<file name>
$ user:PRIMARY> watchCursor = db.getMongo().watch()
$ user:PRIMARY> while (!watchCursor.isExhausted()){ if (watchCursor.hasNext()){ printjson(watchCursor.next());}}
```

### For windows users, if problems occure
#### Viritual Machine:

To get hot-reloading to work with Docker Machine and VirtualBox youâ€™ll need to enable a polling mechanism via chokidar (which wraps fs.watch, fs.watchFile, and fsevents).

##### Step 1: Create a new Machine
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/prereq_editor_jdk_buildtools.adoc[]
##### Step 2: Grab the IP address
```bash
$ docker-machine ip clever
```
##### Step 3: Build the image
```bash
docker build -t marine_client_dev .
```
##### Step 4: Run the container
```bash
docker run -it -v ${PWD}:/app -v /app/node_modules -p 4201:4200 --rm marine_client_dev
```
