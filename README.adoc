This guide walks you through the process of creating the syncing RESTful web service with Spring.

== What You Will Build

You will build a service that will accept HTTP GET requests at

`http://localhost:8080/manualsync?database=${harbor database name}&collection=${harbor collection name}&file=${log file name}&ipAddress=${ip address}`.

`http://localhost:8080/defaultsync?file=${log file name}&ipAddress=${ip address}`.


It will respond with a JSON representation of a response, as the following listing shows:

====
[source,json]
----
{"content": "finished default synking from fileName"}
----
====

====
[source,json]
----
{"content": "finished synking in db: databaseName , col:  collectionName  from  fileName}
----
====

== Starting with Spring Initializr

For all Spring applications, you should start with the https://start.spring.io[Spring
Initializr]. The Initializr offers a fast way to pull in all the dependencies you need for
an application and does a lot of the setup for you. This example needs only the Spring Web
dependency. The following image shows the Initializr set up for this sample project:

NOTE: The preceding image shows the Initializr with Maven chosen as the build tool. It also shows values of `com.example` and `rest-service` as the Group
and Artifact, respectively. You will use those values throughout the rest of this sample.

The following listing shows the `pom.xml` file that is created when you choose Maven:

== Syncing
##### 1. Create a replica set that has only one primary member. 
`https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/deploy-replica-set/`

##### 2. Save the update logs of the primary member in a file (the implementation uses this log file for the syncing)
```shell
$ mongo | tee ${path}\<file name>
$ user:PRIMARY> watchCursor = db.getMongo().watch()
$ user:PRIMARY> while (!watchCursor.isExhausted()){ if (watchCursor.hasNext()){ printjson(watchCursor.next());}}
```
##### 2.1 Alternatively, listen to choosen collections in java instead of the whole database (not used in the implementation)

`https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.watch/index.html#db.collection.watch`

#### Note about the implementation

strength: Easy to modify it so that it syncs based up on all CRUD operation
Weakness:
