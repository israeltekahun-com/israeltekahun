This guide walks you through the process of creating a "`Hello, World`" RESTful web
service with Spring.

== What You Will Build

You will build a service that will accept HTTP GET requests at
`http://localhost:8080/manualsync?database=${harbor database name}&collection=${harbor collection name}&file=${log file name}&ipAddress=${ip address}`.

You will build a service that will accept HTTP GET requests at
`http://localhost:8080/defaultsync?file=${log file name}&ipAddress=${ip address}`.


It will respond with a JSON representation of a response, as the following listing shows:

====
[source,json]
----
{"content": "finished default synking from fileName"}

== Starting with Spring Initializr

For all Spring applications, you should start with the https://start.spring.io[Spring
Initializr]. The Initializr offers a fast way to pull in all the dependencies you need for
an application and does a lot of the setup for you. This example needs only the Spring Web
dependency. The following image shows the Initializr set up for this sample project:

NOTE: The preceding image shows the Initializr with Maven chosen as the build tool. It also shows values of `com.example` and `rest-service` as the Group
and Artifact, respectively. You will use those values throughout the rest of this sample.

The following listing shows the `pom.xml` file that is created when you choose Maven:
